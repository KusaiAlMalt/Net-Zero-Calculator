# This project is a fork of a University project
The project was done in a Agile Project Development course. [This is the original repo](https://github.com/Flob19/DAT257). I had a meaningful part of the project, my school github, QSI_Official, is named after my university nickname which is QSI.

This project is a web-application that uses OpenAI API to analyze emissions (either through PDF or manually typing scopes 1, 2, 3 and profit) and gives feedback on achieving net zero emission through different calculation methods. It also uses a database to save queries for future lookup and easier comparison.

This project was even used by team members in their bachelor thesis.

> Please note that OpenAI requires an API key to operate. Since we have completed this project and passed the course, the OpenAI features will no longer work because the API key balance has been used up. However, you can still try the manual input feature if you decide to run it locally.

## What I learned from this project:
- Collaborated in a 6-person Agile team to design and deliver a carbon footprint calculator aligned with the UNâ€™s global sustainability goals.

- Conducted stakeholder interviews and iteratively refined system requirements to ensure real-world value delivery.

- Applied Scrum practices: sprint planning, weekly stand-ups, retrospectives, and backlog grooming using GitHub Projects.

- Implemented the frontend/backend architecture collaboratively; gained hands-on experience with tools and APIs specific to the sustainability domain.

- Contributed weekly technical and reflective reports documenting team dynamics, learning strategies, and process improvements.

- Practiced continuous integration and code reviews through Git workflows, ensuring team-wide consistency and collaboration.

# Net Zero Calculator
Your journey to a sustainable future starts here. This tool helps your business understand its climate impact by analyzing emissions and offering tailored insights. Make informed, sustainable decisions and take real steps toward net zero. Let's build a thriving future together.

## How to run on your own machine

Don't forget to activate your virtual environment if you are using one

Check the `requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to have the correct dependices

Now run `python manage.py runserver`, then open the `http://...` that comes up on your terminal after running the command

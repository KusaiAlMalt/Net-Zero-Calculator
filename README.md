# This project is a fork of a University project
The project was done in a Agile Project Development course. [This is the original repo](https://github.com/Flob19/DAT257). I had a meaningful part of the project, my school github, QSI_Official, is named after my university nickname which is QSI.

This project is a web-application that uses OpenAI API to analyze emissions (either through PDF or manually typing scopes 1, 2, 3 and profit) and gives feedback on achieving net zero emission through different calculation methods. It also uses a database to save queries for future lookup and easier comparison.

This project was even used by team members in their bachelor thesis.

Please note that the OpenAI needs a key to operate, since we are done with this project and passed the course, the OpanAI feature won't work since the balance for the API key have been used. However you can still try the manual input feature if you ever try it locally.

## What I learned from this project:

# Net Zero Calculator
Your journey to a sustainable future starts here. This tool helps your business understand its climate impact by analyzing emissions and offering tailored insights. Make informed, sustainable decisions and take real steps toward net zero. Let's build a thriving future together.

## How to run on your own machine

Don't forget to activate your virtual environment if you are using one

Check the `requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to have the correct dependices

Now run `python manage.py runserver`, then open the `http://...` that comes up on your terminal after running the command
